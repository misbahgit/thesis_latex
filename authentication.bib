@inproceedings{Gao2008,
abstract = {Alphanumeric passwords are widely used in computer and network authentication to protect users' privacy. However, it is well known that long, text-based passwords are hard for people to remember, while shorter ones are susceptible to attack. Graphical password is a promising solution to this problem. Draw-A-Secret (DAS) is a typical implementation based on the user drawing on a grid canvas. Currently, too many constraints result in reduction in user experience and prevent its popularity. A novel graphical password strategy Yet Another Graphical Password (YAGP) inspired by DAS is proposed in this paper. The proposal has the advantages of free drawing positions, strong shoulder surfing resistance and large password space. Experiments illustrate the effectiveness of YAGP},
